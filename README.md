# Joy 2B+

The idea is to make a modified joystick to support 2 or 3 buttons for an ATARI 2600 or XL/XE. Remember that Atari by default only supports one button.

The testing program and the source of this, which was done in [MADS](http://mads.atari8.info) assembler, is provided.

The technical details to proceed to make the modification visit the [Wiki](../../wiki) here.

Some [games](https://github.com/ascrnet/TestJoy2B/tree/master/games) were also modified to use this joystick.
