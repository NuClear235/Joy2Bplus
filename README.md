# Joy 2B+

The idea is to make a modified joystick to support 2 or 3 buttons for an ATARI 2600 or XL/XE. Remember that Atari by default only supports one button.

The testing program and the source of this, which was done in [MADS](http://mads.atari8.info) assembler, is provided.
If you do not want to assemble, you can lower the [XEX](https://github.com/ascrnet/Joy2Bplus/releases/tag/1.2)

> **Note :** The modified games may also be compatible with a Genesis controller, but only 2 buttons will work.
