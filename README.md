# Joy 2B+

![joy2b](https://github.com/ascrnet/TestJoy2B/blob/master/img/joy2bplus.png)

This small modification is to adapt two or three buttons to a joystick for ATARI 2600/XL/XE.

Some advantages of this project :

 - More than 40 games are available and growing in the future
 - Only the joystick needs to be modified by adding a resistor for each button added
 - Compatible with some sega gamepad to use two buttons
 - For developers it can be emulated from Altirra by configuring a custom joystick
 - Modifications of some commercial joysticks are also available

The technical details to proceed to perform the modification are documented [here](../../wiki/Instructions)

The testing program and the source of this, which was done in [MADS](http://mads.atari8.info) assembler, is provided.
If you do not want to assemble, you can lower the [XEX](https://github.com/ascrnet/Joy2Bplus/releases/tag/1.2)
