![joy2b](https://github.com/ascrnet/TestJoy2B/blob/master/img/joy2bplus.png)

This small modification is to adapt two or three buttons to a joystick for ATARI 2600/XL/XE.

Some advantages of this project :

 - More than 40 games are available and growing in the future
 - Only the joystick needs to be modified by adding a resistor for each button added
 - Compatible with some sega gamepad to use two buttons
 - For developers it can be emulated from Altirra by configuring a custom joystick
 - Modifications of some commercial joysticks are also available
 - A test program is provided for proper testing of all buttons


## Hardware changes

The technical details to proceed to perform the modification are documented [here](../../wiki/Instructions)


## Testing program

this is a small program to test the buttons, it was developed in assembler using [MADS](http://mads.atari8.info) and right here is the source code and its [executable](https://github.com/ascrnet/Joy2Bplus/releases/tag/1.2).


## Games

A [list](https://github.com/ascrnet/Joy2Bplus/wiki/Games) of currently available games and how to test them on Altirra emulator

> **Note :** The modified games may also be compatible with a Genesis controller, but only 2 buttons will work.
